**STEP 1**
-
⭐ 1. a photo-text journal (desc: you'll have 3 seperate tabs, the middle root tab will be a camera, the left tab will be diary notes, and the right tab will be a calender view to see your diary notes over the year/years)
2. a memory sake location social app (desc: you can create entries on certain locations on apple map that can be viewed by other users. the main focus would be to talk about your best memory at X location so other users can view them when considering places to spend time)
⭐ 3. a task simplifer app (desc: i have a lot of issues with executive dysfunction, and i find the best way to help myself break out of it is to simplify tasks until each step is as easy as possible. i would like to create an app that would walk through the steps to simplify a challenging task and then create a to-do list based on this simplification)

**STEP 2**
-
**Photo-text journal**
- Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
    - The app is centered around the native camera feature of the phone and pushes for users to capture things in real-time, so it's uniquely mobile. 
- Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
    - How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
        - The value in the app is surronded around private life documentation, which we lose in a time of social media. I think this is clear.
    - How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
        - I have many friends who use apps like instagram and locket which center around using photos to tell stories about their life. The idea of my app was to make this experience more personal and less focused on making content to be shown to others, but as a personal diary. So, I think my peers who have a similar interest in digital journaling will like this app.
- Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
    - Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
        - Yes. When I was younger, I was very into the hobonichi/bullet journal/traveler journal stationery community. A lot of this was documenting beautiful ways people organized and documented their life privately, but I (and many other young people) find it hard to keep track of physical objects or buy additional things so we can print out images we take.
- Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
    - How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
        - Ideally whenever they have the need to take a photo and attach a note to it. So, if they take photos often, it would be multiple times a day, and especially on big events.
    - Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
        - They create.
- Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
    - How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
        - We haven't discussed how to incorporate a camera view yet so I'm a bit intimidated by that aspect. However, every other part is something we've already done (persiting data, calender view, etc.)
    - How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
        - Very clearly defined. 


**A task simplifer app**
- Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
    - I have a hard time thinking of ways to make this a uniquely mobile experience. Techincally you could make this a website, however, a lot of people would turn to their phone for to-do lists because of the real-time aspect of it and the convienence of their to-do list being a few clicks away rather than the hassle of bringing out their laptop. So, my answer is that it's uniquely mobile by the same principle that the native to-do list is uniquely mobile.
- Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
    - How clear is the value of this app to your audience? 
        - I think this app is very clearly defined for people who have difficulty starting things. I imagine this will be very useful for people who have ADHD, though, who may suffer from executive dysfunction. So, by that principle, I think an app meant to address this has clear value.
    - How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
        - I have a few friends and peers who struggle with ADHD, and even if they don't, college students tend to get overwhelmed with tasks and how to tackle them. This can be a helpful tool for all ages who have to handle complex tasks, so I think the response will be good.
- Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
    - What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
        - Anyone who has tasks they want to break down into simplier tasks. So, a huge amount of people.
    - Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
        - Yes, those with executive dysfunction.
    - Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
        - Students, neurodivergent people, any overlap between the two, etc.
- Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
    - How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
        - Whenever they need to reference a task they need to complete, so multiple times a day.
    - Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
        - Create.
- Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
    - How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
        - Not very techincally challenging. It would require a view segues and maybe a calender view and persistant data.
    - Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
        - Yes.
    - How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
        - Not very clear. I think the general idea is good but I haven't fully thought or imagined how it would be when created.

I decided based on this to do the **photo-text journal**.
