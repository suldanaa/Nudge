## Overview

### Description

A photo-journal app where you're encouraged to take images, add your entries, and look back on your entries throughout the years.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Real-time capturing of your life through your phone camera lenses gives this app a particular need for it to be a mobile app. It wouldn't be able to be a website and hold the same purpose.
- **Story:** We live in a time where many life-documentation apps are based around social engagement. Locket, instagram, snapchat. We have very few photo apps where the main goal is to document things for your own interest in looking back at where you were earlier in the year.
- **Market:** Those who love journaling and life-documentation, but want a more private and accessible way to do such a thing.
- **Habit:** People will use this whenever they get the urge to photograph something, it can be multiple times a day, everyday.
- **Scope:** We haven't discussed how to incorporate a camera view yet so I'm a bit intimidated by that aspect. However, every other part is something we've already done (persiting data, calender view, etc.) However, I have a very clear view of the app.
